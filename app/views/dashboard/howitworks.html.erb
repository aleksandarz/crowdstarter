How it works.

Creat a project by giving a decription and a goal amount.

Collect contributions

If contributions meet or exceed the goal, the money is disbursed to the project owner,
and EverythingFunded takes a 1% fee.

If the goal is not met, all money is returned to the contributors.

For every successfully funded project, a donation is made to a financial literacy non-profit.
